* Abstract
A design methodology that uses Common Lisp's generic functions and method combinations to create flexible, composable systems through protocol definitions rather than inheritance hierarchies.

* Motivation
Instead of asking "what is this thing?" (inheritance), protocol-oriented programming asks "what can this thing do?" This approach leads to more flexible and testable code by focusing on capabilities and behaviors.

* Technical Details
** Protocol Design Patterns
Traditional OOP creates complex inheritance hierarchies that are difficult to modify and test. Protocol-oriented design allows types to implement multiple protocols independently, enabling:
- Mix and match protocols as needed
- Independent testing of protocol implementations
- Easy extension with new protocols
- Clear contracts for expected behavior

** Protocol Definition Framework
*** Core Components
- defprotocol macro: Defines a protocol as a set of generic function signatures
- implement-protocol macro: Implements a protocol for a specific type
- Protocol registry: Tracks which types implement which protocols
- Verification system: Ensures all protocol methods are implemented
- Protocol predicates: Check if objects implement specific protocols

*** Real-World Example: Document Management System
The document management system demonstrates practical protocol usage:
- Base document class with common properties
- Specific document types (PDF, Markdown, Image)
- Multiple protocols implemented by different types:
  - Serializable: Convert to/from serialized format
  - Cacheable: Provide caching behavior
  - Validatable: Ensure document validity

Different document types implement different combinations of protocols based on their capabilities.

* Demo Script
** Setup (1 minute)
1. Show traditional inheritance problems (diamond problem, tight coupling)
2. Introduce protocol-oriented alternative

** Protocol Definition (1.5 minutes)
1. Define protocols for document management
2. Show protocol composition

** Implementation (1.5 minutes)
1. Implement protocols for different document types
2. Show how same type can implement multiple protocols
3. Demonstrate protocol checking

** Practical Benefits (1 minute)
1. Show protocol-based document processing
2. Demonstrate easy extension with new document types
3. Show independent testing of protocol implementations

* Key Takeaways
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Mix and match capabilities
- **Clear Contracts**: Protocols define explicit interfaces
- **Easy Testing**: Test protocol implementations independently
- **Flexible Extension**: Add new types without modifying existing code
- **Reduced Coupling**: Components depend on protocols, not concrete types

* Comparison with Other Languages
- **Swift**: Similar protocol system, but Lisp's macros enable more powerful abstractions
- **Rust**: Traits provide similar functionality, but less runtime flexibility
- **Go**: Interfaces are similar, but Lisp's generic functions are more powerful
- **Java/C#**: Interfaces require explicit declaration, protocols are implicit in Lisp

* Implementation Challenges
- Performance considerations with dynamic dispatch
- Protocol documentation and discoverability
- Integration with existing CLOS-based codebases
- Tooling support for protocol analysis

* Implementation Status

- [x] Implementation verification (70% complete)
- [ ] Development tooling integration (40% complete)
- [ ] Performance optimization (30% complete)
- [ ] Documentation generation (50% complete)
