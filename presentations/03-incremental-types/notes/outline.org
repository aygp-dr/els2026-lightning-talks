* Abstract
A development-time type inference system that builds type knowledge incrementally as code is written and tested, providing optional static analysis benefits while preserving Lisp's dynamic nature.

* Motivation
Unlike traditional static type systems, this approach:
- Learns types from REPL interactions and test execution
- Provides suggestions rather than requirements
- Integrates with existing Common Lisp development workflow
- Builds confidence in type information over time

* Technical Details
** Type Learning Architecture
The system learns types from multiple sources:
- Code Editor: Provides source code AST for analysis
- REPL Session: Captures runtime values and their types
- Test Suite: Extracts type constraints from test execution
- Static Analysis: Adds additional type constraints
- Documentation: Incorporates type annotations from docstrings

All sources feed into a Type Inference Engine that maintains a Type Database, which provides type hints back to the developer.

** Core Implementation
*** Type Inference Engine
- Maintains a database of function and variable types
- Tracks type observations with confidence scores
- Determines most specific types for values
- Updates confidence based on consistency of observations
- Finds common types across multiple observations

*** REPL Integration
- Enables automatic type tracing during evaluation
- Captures argument and return types for functions
- Provides macro for scoped type learning
- Suggests type declarations based on learned types
- Integrates seamlessly with existing REPL workflow

* Demo Script
** Setup (1 minute)
1. Show a simple function without type annotations
2. Enable type learning

** Type Learning (2 minutes)
1. Call function with various inputs (integers, floats, mixed)
2. Show accumulated type knowledge
3. Display confidence levels

** Type Suggestions (2 minutes)
1. Generate suggested type declarations
2. Show confidence levels and conflict detection
3. Demonstrate integration with development environment

* Key Takeaways
- Preserves Lisp's dynamic nature while adding static analysis benefits
- Learns from actual usage patterns rather than programmer declarations
- Provides gradual typing adoption path
- Integrates seamlessly with existing development workflow

* Technical Challenges
- Handling polymorphic functions with multiple valid type signatures
- Balancing type specificity with generality
- Managing type information persistence across sessions
- Integration with macro-heavy codebases
