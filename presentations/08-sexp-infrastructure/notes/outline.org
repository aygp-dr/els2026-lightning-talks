#+PROPERTY: header-args :mkdirp yes

* Talk Outline (5 minutes)

** Current State of Infrastructure (1 minute)
- YAML/JSON configuration hell
- Duplication across environments
- No abstraction or reuse

** S-expressions as Solution (1.5 minutes)
- Configuration as code, literally
- Macros for environment abstraction
- Functions for reusable components

** Live Demo (2 minutes)
- Transform infrastructure config
- Show macro expansion
- Deploy to cloud provider

** Benefits Realized (30s)
- 70% reduction in config files
- Type safety at compile time
- Programmable infrastructure

* Example Configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle infra-config.lisp
(defmacro define-environment (name &key cpu memory replicas)
  `(list :name ,name
         :resources (list :cpu ,cpu :memory ,memory)
         :scaling (list :replicas ,replicas)))

(define-environment production
  :cpu "2000m"
  :memory "4Gi" 
  :replicas 3)
#+END_SRC

* Demo Flow
1. Show traditional YAML
2. Equivalent Lisp version
3. Add abstraction layer
4. Generate multiple environments
5. Deploy with single command
