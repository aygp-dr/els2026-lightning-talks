* Project Structure

Each talk has its own directory containing:
- =outline.org= - Detailed talk outline with timing
- Code examples and demos
- Presentation materials

* ELS Conference Context

Based on the ELS 2025 program, lightning talks are 5-minute presentations that cover:
- Technical innovations
- Experience reports
- Demonstrations
- Research previews

The talks align with ELS themes of language design, practical applications, AI integration, and novel programming paradigms.
