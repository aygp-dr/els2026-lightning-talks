* Overview

Repository for developing potential lightning talks for the European Lisp Symposium 2026, based on research of typical ELS presentations and current trends in the Lisp community.

* Progress Tracking

* Repository Structure

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
els2026-lightning-talks/
├── common/            # Shared resources
├── presentations/     # Individual presentation folders (setup script)
├── talk*/             # Original research talk outlines
├── planning/          # Project planning documents
├── scripts/           # Setup and utility scripts
└── docs/              # Documentation
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each talk directory contains:
- =outline.org= or =README.md= - Detailed talk outline with timing
- =code/= - Code examples and demos
- =notes/= - Development notes and research
- =slides/= - Presentation materials

* Timeline

- **June 2025**: Initial research and concept development
- **September 2025**: First code prototypes
- **December 2025**: Narrow down to 2-3 strongest candidates
- **February 2026**: Final selection and polish
- **April 2026**: Submit final proposal(s) to ELS 2026

* ELS Conference Context

Based on the ELS 2025 program, lightning talks are 5-minute presentations that cover:
- Technical innovations
- Experience reports
- Demonstrations
- Research previews

The talks align with ELS themes of language design, practical applications, AI integration, and novel programming paradigms.

* Development Commands

The project uses Make for build automation. Available commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| =make help= | Show available targets |
| =make setup= | Initialize repository structure |
| =make clean= | Remove generated files (*.fasl, *.pdf, *.html, build/, dist/) |
| =make build= | Build all code examples (Lisp, Racket, Clojure) |
| =make lisp-build= | Build Common Lisp components only |
| =make racket-build= | Build Racket components only |
| =make clojure-build= | Build Clojure components only |
| =make test= | Run tests for all presentations |
| =make docs= | Generate HTML documentation from org files |
| =make presentations= | Build presentation slides (PDF from org files) |
| =make status= | Show development progress and statistics |

* Development Notes

This repository contains two complementary sets of lightning talk ideas:
1. *Setup script talks* - Focus on modern integrations (LLMs, observability, web)
2. *Research talks* - Focus on fundamental innovations (macros, functional ML, DSLs)

Both sets will be developed in parallel, with the strongest candidates selected for final submission to ELS 2026.
