* Five Lightning Talk Proposals for ELS 2026

Based on research of typical ELS presentations and current trends in the Lisp community.

** Talk 1: "Lisp Macros Meet WebAssembly: Compile-Time Magic for Runtime Performance"
- *Duration:* 5 minutes
- *Type:* Technical demonstration
- *Abstract:* Explore how Common Lisp macros can generate optimized WebAssembly code at compile time, bridging the gap between Lisp's expressiveness and modern web performance requirements.

** Talk 2: "Teaching Old REPLs New Tricks: Interactive Debugging in Distributed Lisp Systems"
- *Duration:* 5 minutes  
- *Type:* Experience report
- *Abstract:* Share lessons learned from implementing remote REPL debugging across microservices written in Clojure, including live code patching in production.

** Talk 3: "S-expressions as Infrastructure: Configuration Management with Lisp"
- *Duration:* 5 minutes
- *Type:* Demonstration
- *Abstract:* Demonstrate how treating infrastructure configuration as Lisp code enables powerful metaprogramming capabilities for DevOps automation.

** Talk 4: "The Functional Approach to Machine Learning: Building Neural Networks in Pure Scheme"
- *Duration:* 5 minutes
- *Type:* Research preview
- *Abstract:* Present a purely functional neural network library in Scheme that leverages tail call optimization and immutable data structures for efficient gradient descent.

** Talk 5: "Racket in the Wild: Real-world Domain-Specific Languages for Scientific Computing"
- *Duration:* 5 minutes
- *Type:* Experience report
- *Abstract:* Case study of creating DSLs in Racket for bioinformatics workflows, showing how language-oriented programming solves complex scientific data processing challenges.
