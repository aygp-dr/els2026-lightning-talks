# ELS 2026 Lightning Talk Development

Repository for developing potential lightning talks for the European Lisp Symposium 2026, based on research of typical ELS presentations and current trends in the Lisp community.

## Overview

This repository contains 10 lightning talk proposals organized into two complementary sets:
- **Talks 1-5**: Modern integrations (LLMs, observability, web components)
- **Talks 6-10**: Fundamental innovations (macros, distributed debugging, DSLs)

## Progress Tracking
